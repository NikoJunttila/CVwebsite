Then shrug your shoulders at the top. Press the bar over your head, lock your elbows and shrug your shoulders towards the ceiling. This engages your traps and prevents shoulder impingement.",link:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/F3QY5vMz_6I"},
    {name:"neutral lat pulldown",description:"Our lats won't be able to engage if our torso is upright and our arms are pointing directly up. Like with pull-ups, we need to lean back slightly so that our shoulder socket is pointing a little upwards, allowing us to better engage the lats.When completing a rep, your main focus should be on pulling your elbows down to your sides. This cue will help you to activate your lats more, rather than recruiting other muscles like the biceps to help more than they should",link:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kVB6SlEyjQM"},
    {name:"Face Pull",description:"Face pulls target the posterior deltoids of the shoulder, which are often neglected by other shoulder exercises. You use a cable pulley machine to pull the weight straight toward your forehead. Exercising the rear delts will prevent muscular imbalance and build overall shoulder strength.

    {name:"Romanian Deadlift",description:"Everyone should deadlift - yeah, we said it - but not everyone is ready to deadlift right away. “The Romanian deadlift, in my opinion, is easier to execute correctly than the conventional deadlift,” says Hoobler. “If someone was learning to deadlift, I would start them with this move, with the bar beginning on a rack. This way, they can eccentrically load first, where they're stronger and have more control.” The eccentric phase of the Romanian deadlift is the portion of the lift where the bar is being lowered to the floor. People are usually stronger in the portion of a lift.",link:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2SHsk9AzdjA"},
    {name:"dumbbell row",description:"The dumbbell row, also known as the single-arm dumbbell row, is one of those exercises that will stay in style.

    {name:"Straight Arm Cable Pull Down",description:"The straight arm lat pull down is a variation of the lat pull down and an exercise used to build the muscles of the back. While the exercise will primarily target the lats, you will also notice a fair amount of bicep and middle back activation. The back is a muscle group that requires a fair amount of variation. So, experiment with several different angles and hand positions to maximize your back muscle growth.",link:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r34PR1mxzmU"},
    {name:"dumbbell fly",description:"The dumbbell fly utilizes a chest fly movement pattern to isolate the muscles fo the chest to better help the muscles grow and become stronger. The dumbbell fly is often thought of as a classic bodybuilding movement as the goal of the exercise is to isolate the chest for aesthetic purposes. The movement itself can be used to help build a stronger bench press but isn't typically thought of from an increased performance stand-point. Thus, this movement is best reserved for traditional chest workouts in bodybuilding style splits.",link:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eozdVDA78K0"},
    {name:"pec-deck",description:"A pec deck is a machine designed to increase strength and muscle mass in the chest. It's so effective that the American Council on Exercise ranked it as one of the best exercises for building chest muscles. “The pec deck works both your chest and its supporting muscles, primarily your pectoralis major, which is the muscle that allows you to swing and bring your arms together,” explains Caleb Backe, a certified personal trainer and health and wellness expert for Maple Holistics.",link:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JJitfZKlKk4"},
